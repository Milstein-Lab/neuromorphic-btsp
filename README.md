"**Temporal credit assignment for one-shot learning utilizing a phase transition material**".

In this paper, we simulated the phase transition properties of vanadium oxide (VO2) and used them to perform neuroscience-inspired one-shot learning. 
We demonstrate multiple possible uses of VO2 by integrating these devices into analog electronic circuits for emulating both spiking neurons with variable refractory periods, as well as slow eligibility traces that are critical for behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP) â€” a learning rule inspired directly from experimental observations in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus. We further show how this learning rule can be used for biologically plausibile reinforcement learning to navigate in 2D environments using the Successor Representation.
