# Temporal credit assignment for one-shot learning utilizing a phase transition material

This repository contains the code and data to reproduce the results in the _Galloni et al. 2023_ paper 
"Temporal credit assignment for one-shot learning utilizing a phase transition material". The full paper is available on 
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00066).

In this paper, we simulate the phase transition properties of vanadium oxide (VO2) and use them to perform one-shot learning
by emulating the synaptic plasticity mechanisms observed in biological pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus.
